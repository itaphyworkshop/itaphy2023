## Day 2 - The error day
Trees are based on alignments and distances. Here we covered how to download and format data before and during the analysis, with particular attention to some possible mistakes that can bring to an inaccurate tree inference.

## Day 3 - The gene-tree day
New approaches can now leverage multicopy gene families, so that phylogenetic inference is no longer restricted to the tiny fraction of single-copy genes.

## Day 4 - The clock day
Bayesian approaches to divergence estimation can now analyze genome-scale datasets and hundreds of taxa.
